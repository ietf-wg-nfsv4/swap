--- abstract

The Network File System version 4.2 (NFSv4.2) does not provide
support for the atomic update of data.  This document introduces a
new SWAP operation which provides for such atomic updates.  This
document extends NFSv4.2 (see RFC7862).

# Introduction

With the Network File System version 4.2 (NFSv4.2), atomic updates
to a file are not guaranteed. A single WRITE operation might span
multiple data blocks and another client doing a READ might encounter
a partial WRITE.  In addition, multiple WRITE operations, even
within the same compound, may not be atomically applied to a file.
I.e., multiple WRITE operations within the same compound could be
atomically applied, but that is implementation specific. There is
nothing in the protocol that ensures such coordination.

This document introduces the OPTIONAL to implement SWAP operation
to NFSv4.2 to atomically apply multiple WRITE operations to a file.
A client can easily determine whether or not a server supports the
SWAP operation by examining the return code of the operation.  If
the server does not support the SWAP operation, it will return an
error of NFS4ERR_NOTSUPP.

One way to use the SWAP operation is to CLONE a file and make
modifications to the cloned copy. Once the cloned copy is ready,
the SWAP operation can be used to atomically exchange the modified
contents. Upon success, the cloned copy can be deleted.

## Definitions

The definitions of the following terms are referenced as follows:

- CLONE ({{Section 15.13 of RFC7862}})
- clone_blksize ({{Section 12.2.1 of RFC7862}})
- NFS4ERR_NOTSUPP ({{Section 15.1.1.5 of RFC8881}})
- READ ({{Section 18.22 of RFC8881}})
- WRITE ({{Section 18.32 of RFC8881}})

### DESCRIPTION

The SWAP operation is used to swap file content from a source file
specified by the SAVED_FH value into a destination file specified
by CURRENT_FH without actually copying the data, e.g., by using a
block exchange mechanism.

Both SAVED_FH and CURRENT_FH must be regular files.  If either
SAVED_FH or CURRENT_FH is not a regular file, the operation MUST
fail and return NFS4ERR_WRONG_TYPE.

The sa_dst_stateid MUST refer to a stateid that is valid for a WRITE
operation and follows the rules for stateids in Sections 8.2.5 of
{{RFC7862}} and 18.32.3 of {{RFC8881}}.  The sa_src_stateid MUST
refer to a stateid that is valid for a READ operation and follows
the rules for stateids in Sections 8.2.5 of {{RFC7862}} and 18.22.3
of {{RFC8881}}.  If either stateid is invalid, then the operation
MUST fail.

The sa_src_offset is the starting offset within the source file
from which the data to be swapped will be obtained, and the
sa_dst_offset is the starting offset of the target region into which
the swapped data will be placed.  An offset of 0 (zero) indicates
the start of the respective file.  The number of bytes to be swapped
is obtained from sa_count, except that a sa_count of 0 (zero)
indicates that the number of bytes to be swapped is the count of
bytes between sa_src_offset and the EOF of the source file.  Both
sa_src_offset and sa_dst_offset must be aligned to the clone block
size (Section 12.2.1 of {{RFC7862}}).  The number of bytes to be
swapped must be a multiple of the clone block size, except in the
case in which sa_src_offset plus the number of bytes to be swapped
is equal to the source file size.

If the source offset or the source offset plus count is greater
than the size of the source file, the operation MUST fail with
NFS4ERR_INVAL.  The destination offset or destination offset plus
count may be greater than the size of the destination file.

If SAVED_FH and CURRENT_FH refer to the same file and the source
and target ranges overlap, the operation MUST fail with NFS4ERR_INVAL.

If the target area of the SWAP operation ends beyond the end of the
destination file, the offset at the end of the target area will
determine the new size of the destination file.  The contents of
any block not part of the target area will be the same as if the
file size were extended by a WRITE.

If the area to be swapped is not a multiple of the clone block size
and the size of the destination file is past the end of the target
area, the area between the end of the target area and the next
multiple of the clone block size will be zeroed.

The SWAP operation is atomic in that other operations may not see
any intermediate states between the state of the two files before
the operation and after the operation.  READs of the destination
file will never see some blocks of the target area cloned without
all of them being swapped.  WRITEs of the source area will either
have no effect on the data of the target file or be fully reflected
in the target area of the destination file.

The completion status of the operation is indicated by sr_status.

# Operations and Their Valid Errors

The operations and their valid errors are presented in
{{tbl-ops-and-errors}}.  All error codes not defined in this document
are defined in Section 15 of {{RFC8881}} and Section 11 of {{RFC7862}}.

# Extraction of XDR

This document contains the external data representation (XDR)
{{RFC4506}} description of the SWAP operation.  The XDR description
is presented in a manner that facilitates easy extraction into a
ready-to-compile format. To extract the machine-readable XDR
description, use the following shell script:

~~~ shell
#!/bin/sh
grep '^ *///' $* | sed 's?^ */// ??' | sed 's?^ *///$??'
~~~

For example, if the script is named 'extract.sh' and this document is
named 'spec.txt', execute the following command:

~~~ shell
sh extract.sh < spec.txt > swap_prot.x
~~~

This script removes leading blank spaces and the sentinel sequence '///'
from each line. XDR descriptions with the sentinel sequence are embedded
throughout the document.

Note that the XDR code contained in this document depends on types from
the NFSv4.2 nfs4_prot.x file (generated from {{RFC7863}}).  This includes
both nfs types that end with a 4, such as offset4, length4, etc., as
well as more generic types such as uint32_t and uint64_t.

While the XDR can be appended to that from {{RFC7863}}, the code snippets
should be placed in their appropriate sections within the existing XDR.

# Security Considerations

This document imposes no new security considerations to NFSv4.2.
